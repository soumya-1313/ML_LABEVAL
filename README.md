# **Fuel Dataset Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict the performance of a fuel cell system using multiple machine learning regression models. The primary objective is to estimate the target variable (**Target3**) based on input features from the dataset.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Name:** `Fuel_cell_performance.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains various features related to fuel cell performance, which influence the target variable, **Target3**.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - The dataset was split into **70% training** and **30% testing** subsets.

---

## **Models Used**
The following machine learning regression models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Ridge Regression**
2. **Bayesian Ridge**
3. **Least Angle Regression (LARS)**
4. **Random Forest Regressor**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## **Evaluation Metrics**
The performance of each model was assessed using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

---

## **Results**
- The **best-performing model** was **[RIDGE REFRESSION]**, achieving the highest R² score and lowest error rates.
- Observations from the dataset and models:
  - *Ridge Regression: R² Score = 0.254, RMSE = 4.676*
