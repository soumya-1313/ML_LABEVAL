**Fuel dataset Analysis**

**Overview**
This project predicts the performance of a fuel cell system using multiple machine learning regression models. The goal is to estimate the target variable (Target3) based on input features from the dataset.

**Dataset**
Name: Fuel_cell_performance_data-Full.csv
Description: Contains data related to fuel cell performance, with various features affecting the target variable (Target3).
Preprocessing: Unnamed columns were removed before modeling. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets.

**Models Used**
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Ridge Regression
Bayesian Ridge
Least Angle Regression (LARS)
Random Forest Regressor
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
