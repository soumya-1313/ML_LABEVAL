# **Fuel Dataset Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict the performance of a fuel cell system using multiple machine learning regression models. The primary objective is to estimate the target variable (**Target3**) based on input features from the dataset.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Name:** `Fuel_cell_performance_data-Full.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains various features related to fuel cell performance, which influence the target variable, **Target3**.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Unnamed columns were removed prior to modeling.
  - The dataset was split into **70% training** and **30% testing** subsets.

---

## **Models Used**
The following machine learning regression models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Ridge Regression**
2. **Bayesian Ridge**
3. **Least Angle Regression (LARS)**
4. **Random Forest Regressor**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## **Evaluation Metrics**
The performance of each model was assessed using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R² Score**

| **Model**                | **RMSE** | **MAE** | **R² Score** |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Ridge Regression          | ...      | ...      | ...          |
| Bayesian Ridge            | ...      | ...      | ...          |
| Least Angle Regression    | ...      | ...      | ...          |
| Random Forest Regressor   | ...      | ...      | ...          |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | ...      | ...      | ...          |
